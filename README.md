# SendAppointments
Script for sending notifications about nearest appointments from Outlook calendar
It will notify you if an appointment is having place soon and your PC is locked
The script doestn't send any information about the appointment itself, like a subject or list of participanst.
That can be useful if you have a work mailbox and you must not divulge any work related info.
It can be scheduled for running each 5 minutes. It is recommended to schedule not the Powershell script itself, but the SendAppointments.vbs script, which runs the Powershell script in an hidden window, so it won't bother you.
